                        Economic data are often generated by stochastic processes that take place in continuous time, 
                        though observations may occur only at discrete times.  For example, electricity and gas consumption 
                        take place in continuous time.  Data generated by a continuous time stochastic process are called 
                        functional data.  This paper is concerned with comparing two or more stochastic processes that 
                        generate functional data.  The data may be produced by a randomized experiment in which there are 
                        multiple treatments.  The paper presents a test of the hypothesis that the same stochastic process 
                        generates all the functional data.  In contrast to existing methods, the test described here applies 
                        to both functional data and multiple treatments.  The test is presented as a permutation test, which 
                        ensures that in a finite sample, the true and nominal probabilities of rejecting a correct null 
                        hypothesis are equal.  The paper also presents the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under 
                        alternative hypotheses.  The results of Monte Carlo experiments and an application to an experiment on 
                        billing and pricing of natural gas illustrate the usefulness of the test.
